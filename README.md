# spsearchjs
A JavaScript library for calling the SharePoint Search API's, including those accessible in SharePoint Online.

The primary code is this repository is the SP.Search.js JavaScript library which abstracts the calls to the SharePoint Search REST API using a familiar object model. This library is being developed in the context of a SharePoint-hosted app because this allows us to focus on the code rather than the complexities of things like CORS. These complexities will be considered for future versions of the API.
